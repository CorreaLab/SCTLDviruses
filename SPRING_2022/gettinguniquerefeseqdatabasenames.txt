#we can make a list of the names to reference for downloading, or we can use the list to sort to find the highest number.
#I'm in favor of the first option, because some files are missing and we end up creating empty files...
#For instance, fungi only has 99 files, but its highest value is 103.1. Four numbers are missing, and we created those empty files.
#Not a huge deal, but the list seems usable since I've generated it anyways (I love regex, lol)

 ##regex to create a list of file names we need to download for each database
 #(vertebrate\.)(.+)(\.genomic\.fna\.gz)(.+) #search pattern
 #\2 #keep only the numeric for the genomic.fna.gz files
 #(vertebrate\.)(.+)(\r)(\n) #delete all other file types
 #(\r)(\n)fungi(.+) #for some reason the last line, which is usually not named the same pattern, always has to be deleted.
